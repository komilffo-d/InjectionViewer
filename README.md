# Hi, I'm Daniil! üëã
This software allows you to plot a graph with multiple Y-axes that characterize the volume, specific gravity, pressure and volume of injection.

## Features
- The program has two states - PREPARED(Preparation for construction) and CREATEGRAPH (Built a graph from the entered values).
- Validation of the entered values. Complete inability to enter invalid data.
- Selecting the number of segments to plot (From 2 to 25).
- Export graphics in 2 paper formats - A4, Native (JPG, PNG, BMP).
- Resetting the program status to PREPAIRED (Clearing all input fields, deleting the plotted graph, prohibiting export actions)
- THE MAIN: Modification of the constructed series through manual sculpting.

## Tech Stack

**Client:** .NET 8 C#, WinForms, LiveCharts, State/Observer/Command patterns.
